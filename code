This project involves predicting bike rental counts using machine learning. It includes data preprocessing, feature scaling, and training three regression models: Decision Tree, Linear Regression, and Random Forest. The Random Forest model performed the best, further optimized using GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning. The final model is evaluated on a test set, and the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is calculated. The project also visualizes predicted vs. actual bike rental counts at specific times. This comprehensive approach demonstrates the use of various regression models and hyperparameter optimization for predicting bike rentals.
